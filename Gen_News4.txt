**2. Lunar Base Construction**: "Gaganaut" will lay the groundwork for the establishment of a lunar research base. The mission includes deploying robotic landers and construction equipment to prepare for future human habitation.

**3. Scientific Research**: The mission will conduct extensive scientific research on the moon's geology, mineral resources, and its potential as a platform for astronomical observations.

**4. International Collaboration**: ISRO has expressed its commitment to global collaboration and knowledge-sharing in the realm of lunar exploration, working with other space agencies and research institutions.

### **Prime Minister Vikram Sharma's Vision**

In his address to the nation, Prime Minister Vikram Sharma stated, "Mission 'Gaganaut' represents a giant leap for Indian science and technology. It is a testament to our unwavering commitment to space exploration, innovation, and global cooperation. We aim not only to reach the moon but also to leave our mark in the pages of lunar exploration history."

### **International Acclaim**

The announcement of "Gaganaut" has received widespread international acclaim, with space agencies and governments from around the world expressing their support and interest in collaborating on lunar exploration projects.

### **A Technological Marvel in the Making**

The "Gaganaut" project promises to be a technological marvel, with advanced spacecraft, landers, and life support systems. ISRO has already commenced the astronaut selection and training process, which includes rigorous physical and psychological assessments.

The unveiling of "Gaganaut" marks an exciting chapter in India's space exploration journey, promising to push the boundaries of human knowledge and capability.
