# Indian-Fake-News-Detection

This project focuses on fake news detection using machine learning techniques. The tech stack includes Python, pandas for data manipulation, scikit-learn for machine learning, and Natural Language Processing (NLP) libraries for text analysis. The primary algorithm used is Linear Support Vector Classifier (LinearSVC) for binary classification.

Challenging Parts:

Data Quality: Ensuring a high-quality labeled dataset is crucial. Cleaning, balancing, and preprocessing data for effective training were challenging.

Feature Engineering: Selecting relevant features and text preprocessing required careful consideration to capture fake news patterns.

Dataset Used: IDNF from Kaggle.

Results:

The model achieved accuracy of 96.58% in classifying real and fake news articles. However, challenges remain in handling evolving fake news tactics.
